## API Feedback

Missing api wise to be able to make a decent working chat client:

* No api for unread messages
* No api for listing reactions (or for reacting)
* No avatar for spaces?

* Extremely slow "list room" search (+10 sec) - and no way to search for spaces
* Very slow to search for people one by one
