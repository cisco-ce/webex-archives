# Webex Archives

Simple web service (client only) for downloading Webex chat spaces to your local hard drive.

After you download a space, it is available as a local folder on your disk with HTML file and files for attachement, images and avatars, and can be viewed completely offline and independent of any web service or Webex.

Useful if:

* A colleague is about to leave, and you need to preserve important information from your chat
* You need to keep information from valuable spaces over long time (messages are deleted from Webex after ca 3 years)
* You need to store history for legal reasons

This web tool is inspired by a similar <a href="https://github.com/DJF3/Webex-Message-space-archiver" target="_blank">Python-based archive tool</a> with roughly provides the same feature set.
